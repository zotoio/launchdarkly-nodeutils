    "description": "# Overview\n\n## Authentication\n\nAll REST API resources are authenticated with either [personal or service access tokens](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/account-security/api-access-tokens), or session cookies. Other authentication mechanisms are not supported. You can manage personal access tokens on your [**Account settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/tokens) page.\n\nLaunchDarkly also has SDK keys, mobile keys, and client-side IDs that are used by our server-side SDKs, mobile SDKs, and JavaScript-based SDKs, respectively. **These keys cannot be used to access our REST API**. These keys are environment-specific, and can only perform read-only operations such as fetching feature flag settings.\n\n| Auth mechanism                                                                                  | Allowed resources                                                                                     | Use cases                                          |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |\n| [Personal or service access tokens](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/account-security/api-access-tokens) | Can be customized on a per-token basis                                                                | Building scripts, custom integrations, data export. |\n| SDK keys                                                                                        | Can only access read-only resources specific to server-side SDKs.

Restricted to a single environment.           | Client-side JavaScript                             |\n\n\u003e #### Keep your access tokens and SDK keys private\n\u003e\n\u003e Access tokens should _never_ be exposed in untrusted contexts. Never put an access token in client-side JavaScript, or embed it in a mobile application. LaunchDarkly has special mobile keys that you can embed in mobile apps. If you accidentally expose an access token or SDK key, you can reset it from your [**Account settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/tokens) page.\n\u003e\n\u003e The client-side ID is safe to embed in untrusted contexts. It's designed for use in client-side JavaScript.\n\n### Authentication using request header\n\nThe preferred way to authenticate with the API is by adding an `Authorization` header containing your access token to your requests. The value of the `Authorization` header must be your access token.\n\nManage personal access tokens from the [**Account settings**](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/tokens) page.\n\n### Authentication using session cookie\n\nFor testing purposes, you can make API calls directly from your web browser. If you are logged in to the LaunchDarkly application, the API will use your existing session to authenticate calls.\n\nIf you have a [role](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/team/built-in-roles) other than Admin, or have a [custom role](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/team/custom-roles) defined, you may not have permission to perform some API calls. You will receive a `401` response code in that case.\n\n\u003e ### Modifying the Origin header causes an error\n\u003e\n\u003e LaunchDarkly validates that the Origin header for any API request authenticated by a session cookie matches the expected Origin header. The expected Origin header is `https://app.launchdarkly.com`.\n\u003e\n\u003e If the Origin header does not match what's expected, LaunchDarkly returns an error. This error can prevent the LaunchDarkly app from working correctly.\n\u003e\n\u003e Any browser extension that intentionally changes the Origin header can cause this problem. For example, the `Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *` Chrome extension changes the Origin header to `http://evil.com` and causes the app to fail.\n\u003e\n\u003e To prevent this error, do not modify your Origin header.\n\u003e\n\u003e LaunchDarkly does not require origin matching when authenticating with an access token, so this issue does not affect normal API usage.\n\n## Representations\n\nAll resources expect and return JSON response bodies. Error responses also send a JSON body. To learn more about the error format of the API, read [Errors](/#section/Overview/Errors).\n\nIn practice this means that you always get a response with a `Content-Type` header set to `application/json`.\n\nIn addition, request bodies for `PATCH`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `REPORT` requests must be encoded as JSON with a `Content-Type` header set to `application/json`.\n\n### Summary and detailed representations\n\nWhen you fetch a list of resources, the response includes only the most important attributes of each resource. This is a _summary representation_ of the resource. When you fetch an individual resource, such as a single feature flag, you receive a _detailed representation_ of the resource.\n\nThe best way to find a detailed representation is to follow links. Every summary representation includes a link to its detailed representation.\n\n### Expanding responses\n\nSometimes the detailed representation of a resource does not include all of the attributes of the resource by default. If this is the case, the request method will clearly document this and describe which attributes you can include in an expanded response.\n\nTo include the additional attributes, append the `expand` request parameter to your request and add a comma-separated list of the attributes to include. For example, when you append `?expand=members,roles` to the [Get team](/tag/Teams#operation/getTeam) endpoint, the expanded response includes both of these attributes.\n\n### Links and addressability\n\nThe best way to navigate the API is by following links. These are attributes in representations that link to other resources. The API always uses the same format for links:\n\n- Links to other resources within the API are encapsulated in a `_links` object\n- If the resource has a corresponding link to HTML content on the site, it is stored in a special `_site` link\n\nEach link has two attributes:\n\n- An `href`, which contains the URL\n- A `type`, which describes the content type\n\nFor example, a feature resource might return the following:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"parent\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/features\",\n      \"type\": \"application/json\"\n    },\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/features/sort.order\",\n      \"type\": \"application/json\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"_site\": {\n    \"href\": \"/features/sort.order\",\n    \"type\": \"text/html\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFrom this, you can navigate to the parent collection of features by following the `parent` link, or navigate to the site page for the feature by following the `_site` link.\n\nCollections are always represented as a JSON object with an `items` attribute containing an array of representations. Like all other representations, collections have `_links` defined at the top level.\n\nPaginated collections include `first`, `last`, `next`, and `prev` links containing a URL with the respective set of elements in the collection.\n\n## Updates\n\nResources that accept partial updates use the `PATCH` verb. Most resources support the [JSON patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902) format. Some resources also support the [JSON merge patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7386) format, and some resources support the [semantic patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch) format, which is a way to specify the modifications to perform as a set of executable instructions. Each resource supports optional [comments](/reference#updates-with-comments) that you can submit with updates. Comments appear in outgoing webhooks, the audit log, and other integrations.\n\nWhen a resource supports both JSON patch and semantic patch, we document both in the request method. However, the specific request body fields and descriptions included in our documentation only match one type of patch or the other.\n\n### Updates using JSON patch\n\n[JSON patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902) is a way to specify the modifications to perform on a resource. JSON patch uses paths and a limited set of operations to describe how to transform the current state of the resource into a new state. JSON patch documents are always arrays, where each element contains an operation, a path to the field to update, and the new value.\n\nFor example, in this feature flag representation:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"name\": \"New recommendations engine\",\n    \"key\": \"engine.enable\",\n    \"description\": \"This is the description\",\n    ...\n}\n```\nYou can change the feature flag's description with the following patch document:\n\n```json\n[{ \"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/description\", \"value\": \"This is the new description\" }]\n```\n\nYou can specify multiple modifications to perform in a single request. You can also test that certain preconditions are met before applying the patch:\n\n```json\n[\n  { \"op\": \"test\", \"path\": \"/version\", \"value\": 10 },\n  { \"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/description\", \"value\": \"The new description\" }\n]\n```\n\nThe above patch request tests whether the feature flag's `version` is `10`, and if so, changes the feature flag's description.\n\nAttributes that are not editable, such as a resource's `_links`, have names that start with an underscore.\n\n### Updates using JSON merge patch\n\n[JSON merge patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7386) is another format for specifying the modifications to perform on a resource. JSON merge patch is less expressive than JSON patch. However, in many cases it is simpler to construct a merge patch document. For example, you can change a feature flag's description with the following merge patch document:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"description\": \"New flag description\"\n}\n```\n\n### Updates using semantic patch\n\nThe API also supports the semantic patch format. A semantic patch is a way to specify the modifications to perform on a resource as a set of executable instructions.\n\nSemantic patch allows you to be explicit about intent using precise, custom instructions. In many cases, you can define semantic patch instructions independently of the current state of the resource. This can be useful when defining a change that may be applied at a future date.\n\nTo make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header.\n\nHere's how:\n\n```\nContent-Type: application/json; domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch\n```\n\nIf you call a semantic patch resource without this header, you will receive a `400` response because your semantic patch will be interpreted as a JSON patch.\n\nThe body of a semantic patch request takes the following properties:\n\n* `comment` (string): (Optional) A description of the update.\n* `environmentKey` (string): (Required for some resources only) The environment key.\n* `instructions` (array): (Required) A list of actions the update should perform. Each action in the list must be an object with a `kind` property that indicates the instruction. If the instruction requires parameters, you must include those parameters as additional fields in the object. The documentation for each resource that supports semantic patch includes the available instructions and any additional parameters.\n\nFor example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"comment\": \"optional comment\",\n  \"instructions\": [ {\"kind\": \"turnFlagOn\"} ]\n}\n```\n\nIf any instruction in the patch encounters an error, the endpoint returns an error and will not change the resource. In general, each instruction silently does nothing if the resource is already in the state you request.\n\n### Updates with comments\n\nYou can submit optional comments with `PATCH` changes.\n\nTo submit a comment along with a JSON patch document, use the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"comment\": \"This is a comment string\",\n  \"patch\": [{ \"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/description\", \"value\": \"The new description\" }]\n}\n```\n\nTo submit a comment along with a JSON merge patch document, use the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"comment\": \"This is a comment string\",\n  \"merge\": { \"description\": \"New flag description\" }\n}\n```\n\nTo submit a comment along with a semantic patch, use the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"comment\": \"This is a comment string\",\n  \"instructions\": [ {\"kind\": \"turnFlagOn\"} ]\n}\n```\n\n## Errors\n\nThe API always returns errors in a common format. Here's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"code\": \"invalid_request\",\n  \"message\": \"A feature with that key already exists\",\n  \"id\": \"30ce6058-87da-11e4-b116-123b93f75cba\"\n}\n```\n\nThe `code` indicates the general class of error. The `message` is a human-readable explanation of what went wrong. The `id` is a unique identifier. Use it when you're working with LaunchDarkly Support to debug a problem with a specific API call.\n\n### HTTP status error response codes\n\n| Code | Definition        | Description                                                                                       | Possible Solution                                                |\n| ---- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 400  | Invalid request       | The request cannot be understood.                                    | Ensure JSON syntax in request body is correct.                   |\n| 401  | Invalid access token      | Requestor is unauthorized or does not have permission for this API call.                                                | Ensure your API access token is valid and has the appropriate permissions.                                     |\n| 403  | Forbidden         | Requestor does not have access to this resource.                                                | Ensure that the account member or access token has proper permissions set. |\n| 404  | Invalid resource identifier | The requested resource is not valid. | Ensure that the resource is correctly identified by ID or key. |\n| 405  | Method not allowed | The request method is not allowed on this resource. | Ensure that the HTTP verb is correct. |\n| 409  | Conflict          | The API request can not be completed because it conflicts with a concurrent API request. | Retry your request.                                              |\n| 422  | Unprocessable entity | The API request can not be completed because the update description can not be understood. | Ensure that the request body is correct for the type of patch you are using, either JSON patch or semantic patch.\n| 429  | Too many requests | Read [Rate limiting](/#section/Overview/Rate-limiting).                                               | Wait and try again later.                                        |\n\n## CORS\n\nThe LaunchDarkly API supports Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for AJAX requests from any origin. If an `Origin` header is given in a request, it will be echoed as an explicitly allowed origin. Otherwise the request returns a wildcard, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. For more information on CORS, read the [CORS W3C Recommendation](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors). Example CORS headers might look like:\n\n```http\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: Accept, Content-Type, Content-Length, Accept-Encoding, Authorization\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods: OPTIONS, GET, DELETE, PATCH\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\nAccess-Control-Max-Age: 300\n```\n\nYou can make authenticated CORS calls just as you would make same-origin calls, using either [token or session-based authentication](/#section/Overview/Authentication). If you are using session authentication, you should set the `withCredentials` property for your `xhr` request to `true`. You should never expose your access tokens to untrusted users.\n\n## Rate limiting\n\nWe use several rate limiting strategies to ensure the availability of our APIs. Rate-limited calls to our APIs return a `429` status code. Calls to our APIs include headers indicating the current rate limit status. The specific headers returned depend on the API route being called. The limits differ based on the route, authentication mechanism, and other factors. Routes that are not rate limited may not contain any of the headers described below.\n\n\u003e ### Rate limiting and SDKs\n\u003e\n\u003e LaunchDarkly SDKs are never rate limited and do not use the API endpoints defined here. LaunchDarkly uses a different set of approaches, including streaming/server-sent events and a global CDN, to ensure availability to the routes used by LaunchDarkly SDKs.\n\n### Global rate limits\n\nAuthenticated requests are subject to a global limit. This is the maximum number of calls that your account can make to the API per ten seconds. All personal access tokens on the account share this limit, so exceeding the limit with one access token will impact other tokens. Calls that are subject to global rate limits return the headers below:\n\n| Header name                    | Description                                                                      |\n| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `X-Ratelimit-Global-Remaining` | The maximum number of requests the account is permitted to make per ten seconds. |\n| `X-Ratelimit-Reset`            | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in epoch milliseconds.    |\n\nWe do not publicly document the specific number of calls that can be made globally. This limit may change, and we encourage clients to program against the specification, relying on the two headers defined above, rather than hardcoding to the current limit.\n\n### Route-level rate limits\n\nSome authenticated routes have custom rate limits. These also reset every ten seconds. Any access tokens hitting the same route share this limit, so exceeding the limit with one access token may impact other tokens. Calls that are subject to route-level rate limits return the headers below:\n\n| Header name                   | Description                                                                                           |\n| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `X-Ratelimit-Route-Remaining` | The maximum number of requests to the current route the account is permitted to make per ten seconds. |\n| `X-Ratelimit-Reset`           | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in epoch milliseconds.                         |\n\nA _route_ represents a specific URL pattern and verb. For example, the [Delete environment](/tag/Environments#operation/deleteEnvironment) endpoint is considered a single route, and each call to delete an environment counts against your route-level rate limit for that route.\n\nWe do not publicly document the specific number of calls that an account can make to each endpoint per ten seconds. These limits may change, and we encourage clients to program against the specification, relying on the two headers defined above, rather than hardcoding to the current limits.\n\n### IP-based rate limiting\n\nWe also employ IP-based rate limiting on some API routes. If you hit an IP-based rate limit, your API response will include a `Retry-After` header indicating how long to wait before re-trying the call. Clients must wait at least `Retry-After` seconds before making additional calls to our API, and should employ jitter and backoff strategies to avoid triggering rate limits again.\n\n## OpenAPI (Swagger) and client libraries\n\nWe have a [complete OpenAPI (Swagger) specification](https://app.launchdarkly.com/api/v2/openapi.json) for our API.\n\nWe auto-generate multiple client libraries based on our OpenAPI specification. To learn more, visit the [collection of client libraries on GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Alaunchdarkly-api+org%3Alaunchdarkly\u0026type=Repositories). You can also use this specification to generate client libraries to interact with our REST API in your language of choice.\n\nOur OpenAPI specification is supported by several API-based tools such as Postman and Insomnia. In many cases, you can directly import our specification to explore our APIs.\n\n## Method overriding\n\nSome firewalls and HTTP clients restrict the use of verbs other than `GET` and `POST`. In those environments, our API endpoints that use `DELETE`, `PATCH`, and `PUT` verbs are inaccessible.\n\nTo avoid this issue, our API supports the `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header, allowing clients to \"tunnel\" `DELETE`, `PATCH`, and `PUT` requests using a `POST` request.\n\nFor example, to call a `PATCH` endpoint using a `POST` request, you can include `X-HTTP-Method-Override:PATCH` as a header.\n\n## Beta resources\n\nWe sometimes release new API resources in **beta** status before we release them with general availability.\n\nResources that are in beta are still undergoing testing and development. They may change without notice, including becoming backwards incompatible.\n\nWe try to promote resources into general availability as quickly as possible. This happens after sufficient testing and when we're satisfied that we no longer need to make backwards-incompatible changes.\n\nWe mark beta resources with a \"Beta\" callout in our documentation, pictured below:\n\n\u003e ### This feature is in beta\n\u003e\n\u003e To use this feature, pass in a header including the `LD-API-Version` key with value set to `beta`. Use this header with each call. To learn more, read [Beta resources](/#section/Overview/Beta-resources).\n\u003e\n\u003e Resources that are in beta are still undergoing testing and development. They may change without notice, including becoming backwards incompatible.\n\n### Using beta resources\n\nTo use a beta resource, you must include a header in the request. If you call a beta resource without this header, you receive a `403` response.\n\nUse this header:\n\n```\nLD-API-Version: beta\n```\n\n## Versioning\n\nWe try hard to keep our REST API backwards compatible, but we occasionally have to make backwards-incompatible changes in the process of shipping new features. These breaking changes can cause unexpected behavior if you don't prepare for them accordingly.\n\nUpdates to our REST API include support for the latest features in LaunchDarkly. We also release a new version of our REST API every time we make a breaking change. We provide simultaneous support for multiple API versions so you can migrate from your current API version to a new version at your own pace.\n\n### Setting the API version per request\n\nYou can set the API version on a specific request by sending an `LD-API-Version` header, as shown in the example below:\n\n```\nLD-API-Version: 20220603\n```\n\nThe header value is the version number of the API version you would like to request. The number for each version corresponds to the date the version was released in `yyyymmdd` format. In the example above the version `20220603` corresponds to June 03, 2022.\n\n### Setting the API version per access token\n\nWhen you create an access token, you must specify a specific version of the API to use. This ensures that integrations using this token cannot be broken by version changes.\n\nTokens created before versioning was released have their version set to `20160426`, which is the version of the API that existed before the current versioning scheme, so that they continue working the same way they did before versioning.\n\nIf you would like to upgrade your integration to use a new API version, you can explicitly set the header described above.\n\n\u003e ### Best practice: Set the header for every client or integration\n\u003e\n\u003e We recommend that you set the API version header explicitly in any client or integration you build.\n\u003e\n\u003e Only rely on the access token API version during manual testing.\n\n### API version changelog\n\n|\u003cdiv style=\"width:75px\"\u003eVersion\u003c/div\u003e | Changes | End of life (EOL)\n|---|---|---|\n| `20220603` | \u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eChanged the [list projects](/tag/Projects#operation/getProjects) return value:\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eResponse is now paginated with a default limit of `20`.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdded support for filter and sort.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe project `environments` field is now expandable.

        "description": "Get a list of all features in the given project. By default, each feature includes configurations for each environment. You can filter environments with the `env` query parameter. For example, setting `env=production` restricts the returned configurations to just your production environment. You can also filter feature flags by tag with the tag query parameter.\n\n### Filtering flags\n\nYou can filter on certain fields using the `filter` query parameter. For example, setting `filter=query:dark-mode,tags:beta+test` matches flags with the string `dark-mode` in their key or name, ignoring case, which also have the tags `beta` and `test`.\n\nThe `filter` query parameter supports the following arguments:\n\n- `query` is a string that matches against the flags' keys and names. It is not case sensitive.\n- `archived` is a boolean with values of `true` or `false` that filters the list to archived flags. Setting the value to `true` returns only archived flags. When this is absent, only unarchived flags are returned.\n- `type` is a string allowing filtering to `temporary` or `permanent` flags.\n- `status` is a string allowing filtering to `new`, `inactive`, `active`, or `launched` flags in the specified environment. This filter also requires a `filterEnv` field to be set to a valid environment. For example: `filter=status:active,filterEnv:production`.\n- `tags` is a `+` separated list of tags. It filters the list to members who have all of the tags in the list. For example: `filter=tags:beta+test`.\n- `hasExperiment` is a boolean with values of `true` or `false` that returns any flags that are used in an experiment.\n- `hasDataExport` is a boolean with values of `true` or `false` that returns any flags that are exporting data in the specified environment. This includes flags that are exporting data from Experimentation. This filter also requires that you set a `filterEnv` field to a valid environment key. For example: `filter=hasDataExport:true,filterEnv:production`\n- `evaluated` is an object that contains a key of `after` and a value in Unix time in milliseconds. This returns all flags that have been evaluated since the time you specify in the environment provided. This filter also requires you to set a `filterEnv` field to a valid environment. For example: `filter=evaluated:{\"after\": 1590768455282},filterEnv:production`.\n- `filterEnv` is a string with the key of a valid environment. You can use the `filterEnv` field for filters that are environment-specific. If there are multiple environment-specific filters, you should only declare this parameter once. For example: `filter=evaluated:{\"after\": 1590768455282},filterEnv:production,status:active`.\n\nBy default, this returns all flags. You can page through the list with the `limit` parameter and by following the `first`, `prev`, `next`, and `last` links in the returned `_links` field. These links will not be present if the pages they refer to don't exist. For example, the `first` and `prev` links will be missing from the response on the first page.\n\n### Sorting flags\n\nYou can sort flags based on the following fields:\n\n- `creationDate` sorts by the creation date of the flag.\n- `key` sorts by the key of the flag.\n- `maintainerId` sorts by the flag maintainer.\n- `name` sorts by flag name.\n- `tags` sorts by tags.\n- `targetingModifiedDate` sorts by the date that the flag's targeting rules were last modified in a given environment. It must be used with `env` parameter and it can not be combined with any other sort. If multiple `env` values are provided, it will perform sort using the first one. For example, `sort=-targetingModifiedDate\u0026env=production\u0026env=staging` returns results sorted by `targetingModifiedDate` for the `production` environment.\n- `type` sorts by flag type\n\nAll fields are sorted in ascending order by default. To sort in descending order, prefix the field with a dash ( - ). For example, `sort=-name` sorts the response by flag name in descending order.\n",

        "description": "Perform a partial update to a feature flag. The request body must be a valid semantic patch or JSON patch.\n\n### Using semantic patches on a feature flag\n\nTo make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).\n\nThe body of a semantic patch request for updating feature flags requires an `environmentKey` in addition to `instructions` and an optional `comment`. The body of the request takes the following properties:\n\n* `comment` (string): (Optional) A description of the update.\n* `environmentKey` (string): (Required) The key of the LaunchDarkly environment.\n* `instructions` (array): (Required) A list of actions the update should perform. Each action in the list must be an object with a `kind` property that indicates the instruction. If the action requires parameters, you must include those parameters as additional fields in the object.\n\n### Instructions\n\nSemantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating feature flags.\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eClick to expand instructions for turning flags on and off\u003c/summary\u003e\n\n#### turnFlagOff\n\nSets the flag's targeting state to **Off**.\n\nFor example, to turn a flag off, use this request body:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"environmentKey\": \"example-environment-key\",\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"turnFlagOff\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n#### turnFlagOn\n\nSets the flag's targeting state to **On**.\n\nFor example, to turn a flag on, use this request body:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"environmentKey\": \"example-environment-key\",\n  \"instructions\": [ { \"kind\": \"turnFlagOn\" } ]\n}\n```\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eClick to expand instructions for working with targeting and variations\u003c/summary\u003e\n\nSeveral of the instructions for working with targeting and variations require flag rule IDs, variation IDs, or clause IDs as parameters. Each of these are returned as part of the [Get feature flag](/tag/Feature-flags#operation/getFeatureFlag) response. The flag rule ID is the `_id` field of each element in the `rules` array within each environment listed in the `environments` object. The variation ID is the `_id` field in each element of the `variations` array. The clause ID is the `_id` field of each element of the `clauses` array within the `rules` array within each environment listed in the `environments` object.\n\n#### addClauses\n\nAdds the given clauses to the rule indicated by `ruleId`.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `ruleId`: ID of a rule in the flag.\n- `clauses`: Array of clause objects, with `attribute` (string), `op` (string), `negate` (boolean), and `values` (array of strings, numbers, or dates) properties.\n\n#### addPrerequisite\n\nAdds the flag indicated by `key` with variation `variationId` as a prerequisite to the flag in the path parameter.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `key`: Flag key of the prerequisite flag.\n- `variationId`: ID of a variation of the prerequisite flag.\n\n#### addRule\n\nAdds a new targeting rule to the flag. The rule may contain `clauses` and serve the variation that `variationId` indicates, or serve a percentage rollout that `rolloutWeights` and `rolloutBucketBy` indicate.\n\nIf you set `beforeRuleId`, this adds the new rule before the indicated rule. Otherwise, adds the new rule to the end of the list.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `clauses`: Array of clause objects, with `attribute` (string), `op` (string), `negate` (boolean), and `values` (array of strings, numbers, or dates) properties.\n- `beforeRuleId`: (Optional) ID of a flag rule.\n- `variationId`: ID of a variation of the flag.\n- `rolloutWeights`: Map of `variationId` to weight, in thousandths of a percent (0-100000).\n- `rolloutBucketBy`: (Optional) User attribute.\n\n#### addUserTargets\n\nAdds user keys to the individual user targets for the variation that `variationId` specifies. Returns an error if this causes the flag to target the same user key in multiple variations.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of user keys.\n- `variationId`: ID of a variation on the flag.\n\n#### addValuesToClause\n\nAdds `values` to the values of the clause that `ruleId` and `clauseId` indicate.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `ruleId`: ID of a rule in the flag.\n- `clauseId`: ID of a clause in that rule.\n- `values`: Array of strings.\n\n#### clearUserTargets\n\nRemoves all individual user targets from the variation that `variationId` specifies.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `variationId`: ID of a variation on the flag.\n\n#### removeClauses\n\nRemoves the clauses specified by `clauseIds` from the rule indicated by `ruleId`.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `ruleId`: ID of a rule in the flag.\n- `clauseIds`: Array of IDs of clauses in the rule.\n\n#### removePrerequisite\n\nRemoves the prerequisite flag indicated by `key`.

Changes to the flag configuration in that environment will require creating an [approval request](/tag/Approvals) or a [workflow](/tag/Workflows-(beta)).\n\n### Conflicts\nIf a flag configuration change made through this endpoint would cause a pending scheduled change or approval request to fail, this endpoint will return a 400. You can ignore this check by adding an `ignoreConflicts` query parameter set to `true`.\n",

The flag must already individually target the user.\n\nYou can add, update, or remove a scheduled removal date. You can only schedule a user for removal on a single variation per flag.\n\nThis request only supports semantic patches. To make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).\n\n### Instructions\n\n#### addExpireUserTargetDate\n\nAdds a date and time that LaunchDarkly will remove the user from the flag's individual targeting.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n* `value`: The time, in Unix milliseconds, when LaunchDarkly should remove the user from individual targeting for this flag\n* `variationId`: The version of the flag variation to update. You can retrieve this by making a GET request for the flag.\n* `userKey`: The user key for the user to remove from individual targeting\n\n#### updateExpireUserTargetDate\n\nUpdates the date and time that LaunchDarkly will remove the user from the flag's individual targeting.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n* `value`: The time, in Unix milliseconds, when LaunchDarkly should remove the user from individual targeting for this flag\n* `variationId`: The version of the flag variation to update. You can retrieve this by making a GET request for the flag.\n* `userKey`: The user key for the user to remove from individual targeting\n\n#### removeExpireUserTargetDate\n\nRemoves the scheduled removal of the user from the flag's individual targeting. The user will remain part of the flag's individual targeting until you explicitly remove them, or until you schedule another removal.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n* `variationId`: The version of the flag variation to update.

Updating a flag trigger uses the semantic patch format.\n\nTo make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).\n\n### Instructions\n\nSemantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating flag triggers.\n\n#### replaceTriggerActionInstructions\n\nRemoves the existing trigger action and replaces it with the new instructions.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: An array of the new `kind`s of actions to perform when triggering. Supported flag actions are `turnFlagOn` and `turnFlagOff`.\n\nFor example, to replace the trigger action instructions, use this request body:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"comment\": \"optional comment\",\n  \"instructions\": [\n    {\n      \"kind\": \"replaceTriggerActionInstructions\",\n      \"value\": [ {\"kind\": \"turnFlagOff\"} ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### cycleTriggerUrl\n\nGenerates a new URL for this trigger. You must update any clients using the trigger to use this new URL.\n\n#### disableTrigger\n\nDisables the trigger. This saves the trigger configuration, but the trigger stops running. To re-enable, use `enableTrigger`.\n\n#### enableTrigger\n\nEnables the trigger. If you previously disabled the trigger, it begins running again.\n",

        "description": "Return a list of account members.\n\nBy default, this returns the first 20 members. Page through this list with the `limit` parameter and by following the `first`, `prev`, `next`, and `last` links in the returned `_links` field. These links are not present if the pages they refer to don't exist. For example, the `first` and `prev` links will be missing from the response on the first page.\n\n### Filtering members\n\nLaunchDarkly supports the following fields for filters:\n\n- `query` is a string that matches against the members' emails and names. It is not case sensitive.\n- `role` is a `|` separated list of roles and custom roles. It filters the list to members who have any of the roles in the list. For the purposes of this filtering, `Owner` counts as `Admin`.\n- `team` is a string that matches against the key of the teams the members belong to. It is not case sensitive.\n- `noteam` is a boolean that filters the list of members who are not on a team if true and members on a team if false.\n- `lastSeen` is a JSON object in one of the following formats:\n  - `{\"never\": true}` - Members that have never been active, such as those who have not accepted their invitation to LaunchDarkly, or have not logged in after being provisioned via SCIM.\n  - `{\"noData\": true}` - Members that have not been active since LaunchDarkly began recording last seen timestamps.\n  - `{\"before\": 1608672063611}` - Members that have not been active since the provided value, which should be a timestamp in Unix epoch milliseconds.\n- `accessCheck` is a string that represents a specific action on a specific resource and is in the format `\u003cActionSpecifier\u003e:\u003cResourceSpecifier\u003e`. It filters the list to members who have the ability to perform that action on that resource. \n  - For example, the filter `accessCheck:createApprovalRequest:proj/default:env/test:flag/alternate-page` matches members with the ability to create an approval request for the `alternate-page` flag in the `test` environment of the `default` project.\n  - Wildcard and tag filters are not supported when filtering for access.\n\nFor example, the filter `query:abc,role:admin|customrole` matches members with the string `abc` in their email or name, ignoring case, who also are either an `Owner` or `Admin` or have the custom role `customrole`.\n\n### Sorting members\n\nLaunchDarkly supports two fields for sorting: `displayName` and `lastSeen`:\n\n- `displayName` sorts by first + last name, using the member's email if no name is set.\n- `lastSeen` sorts by the `_lastSeen` property. LaunchDarkly considers members that have never been seen or have no data the oldest.\n",

Page through this list with the `limit` parameter and by following the `first`, `prev`, `next`, and `last` links in the `_links` field that returns. If those links do not appear, the pages they refer to don't exist. For example, the `first` and `prev` links will be missing from the response on the first page, because there is no previous page and you cannot return to the first page when you are already on the first page.\n\n### Filtering projects\n\nLaunchDarkly supports two fields for filters:\n- `query` is a string that matches against the projects' names and keys. It is not case sensitive.\n- `tags` is a `+` separate list of project tags. It filters the list of projects that have all of the tags in the list.\n\nFor example, the filter `query:abc,tags:tag-1+tag-2` matches projects with the string `abc` in their name or key and also are tagged with `tag-1` and `tag-2`. The filter is not case-sensitive.\n\n### Sorting projects\n\nLaunchDarkly supports two fields for sorting:\n- `name` sorts by project name.\n- `createdOn` sorts by the creation date of the project.\n\nFor example, `sort=name` sorts the response by project name in ascending order.\n\n### Expanding the projects response\n\nLaunchDarkly supports one field for expanding the \"List projects\" response. By default, these fields are **not** included in the response.\n\nTo expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add a comma-separated list with the `environments` field.\n\n`Environments` includes a paginated list of the project environments.\n* `environments` includes a paginated list of the project environments.\n\nFor example, `expand=environments` includes the `environments` field for each project in the response.\n",

If those links do not appear, the pages they refer to don't exist. For example, the `first` and `prev` links will be missing from the response on the first page, because there is no previous page and you cannot return to the first page when you are already on the first page.\n\n### Filtering environments\n\nLaunchDarkly supports two fields for filters:\n- `query` is a string that matches against the environments' names and keys. It is not case sensitive.\n- `tags` is a `+` separate list of environment tags. It filters the list of environments that have all of the tags in the list.\n\nFor example, the filter `query:abc,tags:tag-1+tag-2` matches environments with the string `abc` in their name or key and also are tagged with `tag-1` and `tag-2`. The filter is not case-sensitive.\n\n### Sorting environments\n\nLaunchDarkly supports two fields for sorting:\n- `name` sorts by environment name.\n- `createdOn` sorts by the creation date of the environment.\n\nFor example, `sort=name` sorts the response by environment name in ascending order.\n",

Updating a scheduled change uses the semantic patch format.\n\nTo make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).\n\n### Instructions\n\nSemantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating scheduled changes.\n\n#### deleteScheduledChange\n\nRemoves the scheduled change.\n\n#### replaceScheduledChangesInstructions\n\nRemoves the existing scheduled changes and replaces them with the new instructions.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: An array of the new actions to perform when the execution date for these scheduled changes arrives. Supported scheduled actions are `turnFlagOn` and `turnFlagOff`.\n\nFor example, to replace the scheduled changes, use this request body:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"comment\": \"optional comment\",\n  \"instructions\": [\n    {\n      \"kind\": \"replaceScheduledChangesInstructions\",\n      \"value\": [ {\"kind\": \"turnFlagOff\"} ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### updateScheduledChangesExecutionDate\n\nUpdates the execution date for the scheduled changes.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: the new execution date, in Unix milliseconds.\n",

        "description": "Create a workflow for a feature flag. You can create a workflow directly, or you can apply a template to create a new workflow.\n\n### Creating a workflow\n\nYou can use the create workflow endpoint to create a workflow directly by adding a `stages` array to the request body.\n\nFor each stage, define the `name`, `conditions` when the stage should be executed, and `action` that describes the stage.\n\n_Example request body_\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Progressive rollout starting in two days\",\n  \"description\": \"Turn flag on for 10% of users each day\",\n  \"stages\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"10% rollout on day 1\",\n      \"conditions\": [\n        {\n          \"kind\": \"schedule\",\n          \"scheduleKind\": \"relative\", // or \"absolute\"\n              //  If \"scheduleKind\" is \"absolute\", set \"executionDate\";\n              // \"waitDuration\" and \"waitDurationUnit\" will be ignored\n          \"waitDuration\": 2,\n          \"waitDurationUnit\": \"calendarDay\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"kind\": \"ld-approval\",\n          \"notifyMemberIds\": [ \"507f1f77bcf86cd799439011\" ],\n          \"notifyTeamKeys\": [ \"example-team\" ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"action\": {\n        \"instructions\": [\n          {\n            \"kind\": \"turnFlagOn\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"kind\": \"updateFallthroughVariationOrRollout\",\n            \"rolloutWeights\": {\n              \"452f5fb5-7320-4ba3-81a1-8f4324f79d49\": 90000,\n              \"fc15f6a4-05d3-4aa4-a997-446be461345d\": 10000\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Creating a workflow by applying a workflow template\n\nYou can also create a workflow by applying a workflow template. If you pass a valid workflow template key as the `templateKey` query parameter with the request, the API will attempt to create a new workflow with the stages defined in the workflow template with the corresponding key.\n\n#### Applicability of stages\nTemplates are created in the context of a particular flag in a particular environment in a particular project. However, because workflows created from a template can be applied to any project, environment, and flag, some steps of the workflow may need to be updated in order to be applicable for the target resource.\n\nYou can pass a `dryRun` query parameter to tell the API to return a report of which steps of the workflow template are applicable in the target project/environment/flag, and which will need to be updated. When the `dryRun` query parameter is present the response body includes a `meta` property that holds a list of parameters that could potentially be inapplicable for the target resource. Each of these parameters will include a `valid` field. You will need to update any invalid parameters in order to create the new workflow. You can do this using the `parameters` property, which overrides the workflow template parameters.\n\n#### Overriding template parameters\nYou can use the `parameters` property in the request body to tell the API to override the specified workflow template parameters with new values that are specific to your target project/environment/flag.\n\n_Example request body_\n```json\n{\n\t\"name\": \"workflow created from my-template\",\n\t\"description\": \"description of my workflow\",\n\t\"parameters\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"_id\": \"62cf2bc4cadbeb7697943f3b\",\n\t\t\t\"path\": \"/clauses/0/values\",\n\t\t\t\"default\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"value\": [\"updated-segment\"]\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"_id\": \"62cf2bc4cadbeb7697943f3d\",\n\t\t\t\"path\": \"/variationId\",\n\t\t\t\"default\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"value\": \"abcd1234-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcd12\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t]\n}\n```\n\nIf there are any steps in the template that are not applicable to the target resource, the workflow will not be created, and the `meta` property will be included in the response body detailing which parameters need to be updated.\n",

        "description": "Update a user segment. The request body must be a valid semantic patch, JSON patch, or JSON merge patch.\n\n### Using semantic patches on a segment\n\nTo make a semantic patch request, you must append `domain-model=launchdarkly.semanticpatch` to your `Content-Type` header. To learn more, read [Updates using semantic patch](/reference#updates-using-semantic-patch).\n\nThe body of a semantic patch request for updating segments requires an `environmentKey` in addition to `instructions` and an optional `comment`. The body of the request takes the following properties:\n\n* `comment` (string): (Optional) A description of the update.\n* `environmentKey` (string): (Required) The key of the LaunchDarkly environment.\n* `instructions` (array): (Required) A list of actions the update should perform. Each action in the list must be an object with a `kind` property that indicates the instruction. If the action requires parameters, you must include those parameters as additional fields in the object.\n\n### Instructions\n\nSemantic patch requests support the following `kind` instructions for updating segments.\n\n#### addIncludedUsers\n\nAdds user keys to the individual user targets included in the segment. Returns an error if this causes the same user key to be both included and excluded.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of user keys.\n\n#### addExcludedUsers\n\nAdds user keys to the individual user targets excluded from the segment. Returns an error if this causes the same user key to be both included and excluded.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of user keys.\n\n#### removeIncludedUsers\n\nRemoves user keys from the individual user targets included in the segment.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of user keys.\n\n#### removeExcludedUsers\n\nRemoves user keys from the individual user targets excluded from the segment.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `values`: List of user keys.\n\n#### updateName\n\nUpdates the name of the segment.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n- `value`: Name of the segment.\n\n## Using JSON patches on a segment\n\nYou can also use JSON patch. To learn more, read [Updates using JSON patches](/reference#updates-using-json-patch).\n\nFor example, to update the description for a segment, use the following request body:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"patch\": [\n    {\n      \"op\": \"replace\",\n      \"path\": \"/description\",\n      \"value\": \"new description\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nTo update fields in the segment that are arrays, set the `path` to the name of the field and then append `/\u003carray index\u003e`. Using `/0` adds the new entry to the beginning of the array.\n\nFor example, to add a rule to a segment, use the following request body:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"patch\":[\n    {\n      \"op\": \"add\",\n      \"path\": \"/rules/0\",\n      \"value\": {\n        \"clauses\": [{ \"attribute\": \"email\", \"op\": \"endsWith\", \"values\": [\".edu\"], \"negate\": false }]\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nTo add or remove users from segments, we recommend using semantic patch. Semantic patch for segments includes specific `instructions` for adding and removing both included and excluded users.\n",

It is not case-sensitive.\n  - A request with `query:abc` returns teams with the string `abc` in their name or key.\n- `nomembers` is a boolean that filters the list of teams who have 0 members\n  - A request with `nomembers:true` returns teams that have 0 members\n  - A request with `nomembers:false` returns teams that have 1 or more members\n\n### Expanding the teams response\nLaunchDarkly supports four fields for expanding the \"List teams\" response. By default, these fields are **not** included in the response.\n\nTo expand the response, append the `expand` query parameter and add a comma-separated list with any of the following fields:\n\n* `members` includes the total count of members that belong to the team.\n* `roles` includes a paginated list of the custom roles that you have assigned to the team.\n* `projects` includes a paginated list of the projects that the team has any write access to.\n* `maintainers` includes a paginated list of the maintainers that you have assigned to the team.\n\nFor example, `expand=members,roles` includes the `members` and `roles` fields in the response.\n",

You can include data in additional columns, but LaunchDarkly ignores all data outside the first column. Headers are optional. To learn more, read [Managing team members](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/teams/managing#managing-team-members).\n\n**Members are only added on a `201` response.** A `207` indicates the CSV file contains a combination of valid and invalid entries. A `207` results in no members being added to the team.\n\nOn a `207` response, if an entry contains bad user input, the `message` field contains the row number as well as the reason for the error. The `message` field is omitted if the entry is valid.\n\nExample `207` response:\n```json\n{\n  \"items\": [\n    {\n      \"status\": \"success\",\n      \"value\": \"a-valid-email@launchdarkly.com\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"message\": \"Line 2: empty row\",\n      \"status\": \"error\",\n      \"value\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"message\": \"Line 3: email already exists in the specified team\",\n      \"status\": \"error\",\n      \"value\": \"existing-team-member@launchdarkly.com\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"message\": \"Line 4: invalid email formatting\",\n      \"status\": \"error\",\n      \"value\": \"invalid email format\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nMessage | Resolution\n--- | ---\nEmpty row | This line is blank. Add an email address and try again.\nDuplicate entry | This email address appears in the file twice. Remove the email from the file and try again.\nEmail already exists in the specified team | This member is already on your team. Remove the email from the file and try again.\nInvalid formatting | This email address is not formatted correctly. Fix the formatting and try again.\nEmail does not belong to a LaunchDarkly member | The email address doesn't belong to a LaunchDarkly account member. Invite them to LaunchDarkly, then re-add them to the team.\n\nOn a `400` response, the `message` field may contain errors specific to this endpoint.\n\nExample `400` response:\n```json\n{\n  \"code\": \"invalid_request\",\n  \"message\": \"Unable to process file\"\n}\n```\n\nMessage | Resolution\n--- | ---\nUnable to process file | LaunchDarkly could not process the file for an unspecified reason. Review your file for errors and try again.\nFile exceeds 25mb | Break up your file into multiple files of less than 25mbs each.\nAll emails have invalid formatting | None of the email addresses in the file are in the correct format. Fix the formatting and try again.\nAll emails belong to existing team members | All listed members are already on this team. Populate the file with member emails that do not belong to the team and try again.\nFile is empty | The CSV file does not contain any email addresses. Populate the file and try again.\nNo emails belong to members of your LaunchDarkly organization | None of the email addresses belong to members of your LaunchDarkly account.

For example, to change the name of a feature, [update the feature flag](#operation/patchFeatureFlag) with the `name` attribute set to the new name:\n\n```json\n[\n    { \"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/name\", \"value\": \"New name\" }\n]\n```\n\nThe `variations` array represents the different variation values that a feature flag has. For a boolean flag, there are two variations: `true` and `false`. Multivariate flags have more variation values, and those values could be any JSON type: numbers, strings, objects, or arrays. In targeting rules, the variations are referred to by their index into this array. Below are some specific examples.\n\n## Per-environment configurations\n\nEach entry in the `environments` map contains a JSON object that represents the environment-specific flag configuration data available in the flag's Targeting tab. For example, to toggle off a feature flag in your production environment, use the following JSON patch operation:\n\n```json\n[\n    { \"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/environments/production/on\", \"value\": false }\n]\n```\n\nTo learn more, read [Targeting users](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/flags/targeting-users).\n\nEach section of the Targeting tab corresponds to a different attribute of the per-environment configuration data, as shown here:\n\n## Individual user targets\n\nThe `targets` array in the per-environment configuration data represents the individual user targeting rules on the Targeting tab. To learn more, read [Targeting users](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/flags/targeting-users).\n\nEach object in the `targets` array represents a list of user keys assigned to a particular variation. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n    ...\n    \"environments\" : {\n        \"production\" : {\n            ...\n            \"targets\": [\n                {\n                    \"values\": [\"foo@example.com\"],\n                    \"variation: 0\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis `targets` array here means that user `foo@example.com` receives the first variation listed in the `variations` array. Recall that the variations are stored at the top level of the flag JSON in an array, and the per-environment configuration rules point to indexes into this array. If this is a boolean flag, `foo@example.com` is receiving the `true` variation.\n\n## Targeting rules\n\nThe `rules` array corresponds to the custom targeting rules section of the Targeting tab. This is where you can express complex rules on attributes with conditions and operators. For example, a rule like \"roll out the `true` variation to 80% of users whose email address ends with `gmail.com` could be expressed here. To learn more, read [Creating targeting rules](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/flags/targeting-users#creating-targeting-rules).\n\n## The fallthrough rule\n\nThe `fallthrough` object is a special rule that contains no conditions. It is the rollout strategy that is applied when none of the individual or custom targeting rules match. In the LaunchDarkly UI, it is called the \"Default rule.\"\n\n## The off variation\n\nThe off variation represents the variation to serve if the feature flag is turned off, meaning the `on` attribute is `false`. For boolean flags, this is usually `false`. For multivariate flags, set the off variation to whatever variation represents the control or baseline behavior for your application. If you don't set the off variation, LaunchDarkly will serve the fallback value defined in your code.\n\n## Percentage rollouts\n\nThe `weight` attribute defines the percentage rollout for each variation. Weights range from 0 (a 0% rollout) to 100000 (a 100% rollout). The weights are scaled by a factor of 1000 so that fractions of a percent can be represented without using floating-point. For example, a weight of `50000` means that 50% of users that don't otherwise match any `targets` will see that variation. The sum of weights across all variations should be 100%.\n"

To learn more, read [Get audit log entry](/tag/Audit-log#operation/getAuditLogEntry).\n\nHere's a sample payload:\n\n\u003e ### Webhook delivery order\n\u003e\n\u003e Webhooks may not be delivered in chronological order. We recommend using the payload's \"date\" field as a timestamp to reorder webhooks as they are received.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"canonical\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/v2/projects/alexis/environments/test\",\n      \"type\": \"application/json\"\n    },\n    \"parent\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/v2/auditlog\",\n      \"type\": \"application/json\"\n    },\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/v2/auditlog/57c0a8e29969090743529965\",\n      \"type\": \"application/json\"\n    },\n    \"site\": {\n      \"href\": \"/settings#/projects\",\n      \"type\": \"text/html\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"_id\": \"57c0a8e29969090743529965\",\n  \"date\": 1472243938774,\n  \"accesses\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"updateName\",\n      \"resource\": \"proj/alexis:env/test\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"kind\": \"environment\",\n  \"name\": \"Testing\",\n  \"description\": \"- Changed the name from ~~Test~~ to *Testing*\",\n  \"member\": {\n    \"_links\": {\n      \"parent\": {\n        \"href\": \"/internal/account/members\",\n        \"type\": \"application/json\"\n      },\n      \"self\": {\n        \"href\": \"/internal/account/members/548f6741c1efad40031b18ae\",\n        \"type\": \"application/json\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"_id\": \"548f6741c1efad40031b18ae\",\n    \"email\": \"refapp@launchdarkly.com\",\n    \"firstName\": \"Reese\",\n    \"lastName\": \"Applebaum\"\n  },\n  \"titleVerb\": \"changed the name of\",\n  \"title\": \"[Reese Applebaum](mailto:refapp@launchdarkly.com) changed the name of [Testing](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects)\",\n  \"target\": {\n    \"_links\": {\n      \"canonical\": {\n        \"href\": \"/api/v2/projects/alexis/environments/test\",\n        \"type\": \"application/json\"\n      },\n      \"site\": {\n        \"href\": \"/settings#/projects\",\n        \"type\": \"text/html\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"name\": \"Testing\",\n    \"resources\": [\"proj/alexis:env/test\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Signing the webhook\n\nOptionally, you can define a `secret` when you create a webhook. If you define the secret, the webhook `POST` request will include an `X-LD-Signature header`, whose value will contain an HMAC SHA256 hex digest of the webhook payload, using the `secret` as the key.\n\nCompute the signature of the payload using the same shared secret in your code to verify that the webhook was triggered by LaunchDarkly.\n\n## Understanding connection retries\n\nIf LaunchDarkly receives a non-`2xx` response to a webhook `POST`, it will retry the delivery one time. Webhook delivery is not guaranteed. If you build an integration on webhooks, make sure it is tolerant of delivery failures.\n"
